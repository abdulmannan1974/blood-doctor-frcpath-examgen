# 6. Guideline Alignment Checklist

Use this checklist for each question generated:

- [ ] Based on current guideline (year specified)
- [ ] Reflects best practice in UK context
- [ ] Uses appropriate terminology
- [ ] Includes management aligned with guideline
- [ ] Safety aspects highlighted
- [ ] Patient perspective considered

# 7. Trainee Development Pathway

**Difficulty progression**

- Foundation: single concept testing, clear answers
- Intermediate: scenario‑based, moderate complexity
- Advanced: synthesis of multiple areas, real‑world complexity

**Suggested learning sequence**

1. Complete all Part 1 materials
2. Review critical investigations module
3. Begin Part 2 morphology cases (6‑12 months pre‑exam)
4. Haemostasis/transfusion detailed case work (3‑6 months pre‑exam)
5. Mock vivas (1‑3 months pre‑exam)

---

# 8. Maintenance and Updates

**Annual review**

- Update guidelines as new versions released
- Add new case scenarios from clinical practice
- Retire outdated questions
- Incorporate trainee feedback
- Monitor FRCPath exam changes

**Quarterly additions**

- New cases from national haematology meetings
- NEQAS challenges (when available)
- Recent literature highlights
